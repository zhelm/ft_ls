//I am going to make a linked list. I will have to sort it hexicographicaly as a normal mode
// 
//When a directory has subdirectories I will make a list that is the same and then merge the segment in between
// the current list and the next one. then I will check if those ones dont have subdirectories, if the have then I will
// need to do the same as for the first segment
// 
//When the list is at the end I will start at the head and move toward the end of the list and join the names of the directories 
// to be able to open and read those directories. I might actualy want to do the segments a bit differently. Maybe 
// I should as soos as I am done with a node after I have made the segment I should print the contents of the node and free it
// lets say zhain/helm ok hello its me. I would write all files of zhain onto the screen and then make nodes for helm ok hello its me
// sort it as specified and then join them like this helm->ok->hello->its->me->next. go through each of them print their contents
// if there are subdirectories make another segment and stick it between helm->...->ok. and so forth. free the head and let head point to
// next;
